AI-Powered Parking Space Detection Using Python &amp; Scikit-Learn

we build an image classifier using Python, Scikit-Learn, and Scikit-Image to analyze a large parking area and classify parking spots as empty or occupied. Using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and GridSearchCV, we train an optimized model for smart parking management.

Whatâ€™s Inside:
Loading and preprocessing images with Scikit-Image
Resizing and flattening data for machine learning
Training an SVM model with hyperparameter tuning
Evaluating model accuracy with Scikit-Learn
Saving the trained model using Pickle
Technologies Used:
Python
Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)
Scikit-Image (Image Processing)
NumPy (Data Handling)
OpenCV (optional for future enhancements)
Potential Applications:
Smart parking systems
Real-time parking monitoring
AI-based space utilization
