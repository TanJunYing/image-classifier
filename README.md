# image-classifier-python-scikit-learn
## Project Overview

This is an image classifier using Python, Scikit-Learn, and Scikit-Image to analyze a large parking area and classify parking spots as empty or occupied. Using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and GridSearchCV, we train an optimized model for smart parking management.

## Whatâ€™s Inside:
- Loading and preprocessing images with Scikit-Image
- Resizing and flattening data for machine learning
- Training an SVM model with hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluating model accuracy with Scikit-Learn
- Saving the trained model using Pickle

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)
- Scikit-Image (Image Processing)
- NumPy (Data Handling)
- OpenCV (optional for future enhancements)

## Potential Applications:
- Smart parking systems
- Real-time parking monitoring
- AI-based space utilization


## Getting Started:
Once you have the prerequisites, you can install the required packages by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt
